# Todo List Project
A project to practice this technology with a to-do list.

I am going to create a simple task list application where users can add, view, and remove tasks.

##  Home Screen
- Displays a list of user-created tasks.
- Each task can be marked as completed or not.
<<<<<<< HEAD
- The user can click on a task to view more details or edit.
- The user on pressed over the task, and it's show a dialog screen to view the name and description
- In this screen can also delete this task
- The user can press on a task to view more details, delete, or edit it.
  - To delete a task, the user must click a delete button.
  - To edit the title or description, the user must double-tap the title or description field.
- The data is persisted in a database file, todo_list.db, using SQLite.
  - The data will be lost if the app is uninstalled.
