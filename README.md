# todo_list_project

Project to practice this technology, with a to-do list

---

I`m going to create a simple task list application where the user can add, view and remove tasks.

##  Home screen (Home Screen):

- Displays a list of user-created tasks.
- Each task can be marked as completed or not.
- The user can click on a task to view more details or edit.
- The user on pressed over the task, and it's delete (The next feature change this behavior)
